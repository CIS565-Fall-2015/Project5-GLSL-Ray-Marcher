TODO:
-get a sphere working [done]
-add material color return in scenegraph check [done]
	-and use it in render [done]
-add union op [done]
-add plane check [done]
-add cube check [done]
-add normal [done]
-add light [done]
-add sphere tracing [buggy]

-extract and generalize transformation operator. see if it fixes the sphere tracing problem?
	-no good. can't generalize transformation op
	-besides, it's only a problem with scaled spheres

-add height-mapped terrain
	-add a function that, given an xz coordinate, computes pseudorandom noise
	-add a primitive that takes all 3 transforms and does the height mapped thing

-add fractal menger sponge
	-primitive that should take in transforms and an iteration depth
	-come up with an iterative method for computing menger depth
	-something something something iterate if the point is in some region

-add soft shadows
-add ambient occlusion
