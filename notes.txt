TODO:
-get a sphere working [done]
-add material color return in scenegraph check [done]
	-and use it in render [done]
-add union op [done]
-add plane check [done]
-add cube check [done]
-add normal [done]
-add light [done]
-add sphere tracing [buggy]

-extract and generalize transformation operator. see if it fixes the sphere tracing problem?
	-no good. can't generalize transformation op when scale is nonuniform
	-besides, it's only a problem with nonuniform scaled spheres

-add height-mapped terrain [done. kinda.]
	-add a function that, given an xz coordinate, computes pseudorandom noise [done?]
		-just using sin functions for now. perlin noise later?
	-add a primitive that takes all 3 transforms and does the height mapped thing [done]

-add fractal menger sponge
	-primitive that should take in transforms and an iteration depth
	-come up with an iterative method for computing menger depth
	-something something something iterate if the point is in some region

-add soft shadows [done. but not very pretty]
	-intuition from the slides: march towards the light from point
		-accumulate distance to the occluder. use that to determine shadow strength
		-IQ's slides back this up: use samples of distance to closest geometry along line from surface to light
		-also, the reading article source thing
		-you can multiply the shadow term right onto the lambert computation.
		-may need to move ambient outside of lambert shading
	-TODO:
		-modify the scene so you'll actually be able to see shadows [done]
		-add a hard shadow function. takes in light, ray origin, ray direction. keep epsilon and max consistent! [done]
		-add a soft shadow function. [done]

-add ambient occlusion [done. but not very pretty]
	-intuition from IQ's slides:
		-sample nearest points along the point normal
		-compare these to camera -> point distance
	-overall intuition:
		-use distance function to estimate if other things are close to the point to be shaded

-add debugging [done] and do some profiling

-distance to surface (depth basically?) [done]

-ray march iterations [done]

-oddly, the menger sponge works with sphere mode and it's FAST

NAIVE RAY MARCHING VS SPHERE TRACING
-naive: around 170 ms per frame in a full circle pass
-sphere: around 60 ms per frame in a full circle pass

TIME SPENT RAY MARCHING VS SHADING/LIGHTING
-pure lambert: around 120 ms per frame in a full circle pass

-shadow: about 150 ms per frame in a full circle pass 

-AO: about 130 ms per frame in a full circle pass

-shadow + AO: about 170 ms per frame in a full circle pass
